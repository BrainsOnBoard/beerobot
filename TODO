- bug: if Q pressed, program only quits if user also presses controller button
- show camera display even if controller not present

- bee eye:
-- change to using panoramic mirror
-- display is small
-- only one eye displayed
-- eye is off to left with lots of unused pixels
-- "background" is patchy and changes colour with camera input
